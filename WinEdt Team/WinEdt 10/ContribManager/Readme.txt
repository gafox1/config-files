This package provides support for the LaTeX package "acronym" and
for acronyms in the LaTeX packages "glossaries" and
"glossaries-extra".

---------------------------
 INSTALLATION
---------------------------

Open the macro file "Install.edt" in WinEdt, and execute it by
choosing "Macros" menu > "Execute Current Macro".

---------------------------
 UNINSTALLATION
---------------------------

Open the macro file "Uninstall.edt" in WinEdt (also available in
%b\Uninstall\Acronym folder), and execute it by choosing "Macros"
menu > "Execute Current Macro".

---------------------------
 USAGE
---------------------------

Acronyms are collected both by the Tree and the Gather interfaces.
They are shown with a purple flag under the Glossary items. You
can use \cite-like active strings to help you with inserting
items. For example, typing \ac{} pops up the GDI interface related
to acronym items.
